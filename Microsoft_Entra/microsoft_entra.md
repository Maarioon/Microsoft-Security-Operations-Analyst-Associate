## Security is a major part of deployment, builds and usage. There are different ways of implementing security, either through tools, or via the code base.

## Microsoft Security Copilot
Microsoft Security Copilot‚ÄÇis a security assistant that leverages AI to help security analysts detect, investigate, and respond to threats in a more optimized way. It uses sophisticated AI models to process security data, automate mundane tasks and offer intuitive, actionable insights, which improve the‚ÄÇsecurity position and operational effectiveness.

## Azure
Microsoft Azure is a cloud offering by Microsoft that provides‚ÄÇa number of cloud services like virtual machines, databases, networking, AI and analytics among others. Organizations can‚ÄÇuse Azure Classic to distribute, develop and run applications, and store with the freedom and flexibility of a large-scale cloud hosting service.

## Microsoft Entra
Microsoft Entra is an all-in-identity and access‚ÄÇmanagement offering. It are used to provide access to cloud and on-premises resources, to manage user identities,‚ÄÇand to enforce security policies.
and configure‚ÄÇsingle sign-on (SSO), requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA), and access/identity/security governance.It was formerly know as Azure Active directory.

It is a was to monitor, create resources, users, change user permissions, customise domains amongst other, all it's services are to help make work easier.

## Global Administrator Role
Sometimes the role one holds determines the type of access granted for specific tasks or uses. There are different roles, an example is the global administrator role.

The Global‚ÄÇAdministrator is a privileged role in Microsoft 365 and Azure AD. Users assigned this role have full control over all admin features in all Microsoft services, such‚ÄÇas user management, billing, security settings, and service settings. It is usually designated for trusted security personnel who monitor and control settings and‚ÄÇservices across tenants.

Here is a simple explanation of the above:
Azure ‚Äì cloud‚ÄÇbased platform for hosting, managing and building applications.

Microsoft Entra: An identity and‚ÄÇaccess management platform.

Global Administrator: Admin‚ÄÇthat has access to everything in Microsoft 365 and Azure AD.

This is a project designed to‚ÄÇteach to set up permissions and provision capacity for Microsoft Security Copilot in Azure.

Even if you‚Äôre a beginner with Azure‚ÄÇor Copilot, don‚Äôt worry! In this‚ÄÇguide you‚Äôll learn everything in super simple, easy to follow steps.

##  What is this about?

Before people can start using **Security Copilot**, an admin needs to **provision capacity** and **set permissions**.

**Imagine you have a toy box üéÅ, and only people with keys üîë can open it and play with the toys.**  
In this case:
- **Copilot** = The toy box  
- **Admins** = People with keys  
- **Permissions** = The keys to open and play  

This guide teaches you how to get those keys and set up your toy box.

---

##  Prerequisites

Before you start, you must have:

 An **Azure subscription**  
 Be an **Azure Owner** or **Contributor** (at least at the resource group level)

## üõ†Ô∏è Task 1: Set Role Permissions

###  Why is this needed?  

Azure and **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)** are like two different playgrounds üõù.  
Being a big boss in one playground doesn‚Äôt automatically make you a boss in the other.

To manage everything, you need a **special pass (User Access Administrator role)** at the very top (called **root scope (/)**).
